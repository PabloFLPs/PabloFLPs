## Projects

### NextJS Pokedex:

- Below you can access my Pokedex deployed on Vercel. It was made utilizing JavaScript as language, Tailwind as CSS framework, NextJS as React framework and and finally the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

</a>

**Description:** I made this based on the video [Build a Pokedex with NextJS and Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMRAEUPkFXI). It covers from #1 Bulbasaur to #898 Calyrex; all pokemon generations. The application shows pokemon weight, height, types and abilities. Soon I will add "strong" and "weak" against data.

### Ignite Platform:

- This is my Ignite games application. It is a place to search games and stay tuned about game details, and also upcoming titles, popular games and new games. Made utilizing [RAWG.io](https://rawg.io/).

**Description:** I made this based on the Dev Ed youtuber Redux course. Started to study Redux for my web development knowledge and this project was very cool to increase my skills in Redux. Made with React & Redux, utilizing Thunk and styled components.

### Podcastr Application:
